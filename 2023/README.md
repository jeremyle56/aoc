C++ Template courtesy of https://github.com/osalbahr. Inspired and modified.

# Example use of Template

## Folder Creation

```bash
$ ./newday.sh day24    # Add "&& code day24" if you also want to open it in Visual Studio Code
$ ./newday_py.sh day24 # For Python template
```

## Program Compilation

```bash
$ cd day24
$ make # Only for C++
```

## Running Code on Input

Edit `input.txt` with your input then to run your code:

```bash
$ ./day24          # For C++
$ python3 day24.py # For Python
```
