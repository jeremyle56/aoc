# Advent of Code 2023

I don't know what language I'll use, probably C++ to start.

- Day 1-3: C++
- Day 4-5: Python (no time)

C++ Template courtesy of https://github.com/osalbahr. Inspired and modified.

# Example use of Template

```bash

```

## Program Compilation

$ cd day24
$ make
```

## Running Code on Input

Edit `input.txt` with your input.
